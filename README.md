A remote controller mobile app that sends keystrokes to a windows machine.

## Goal
goal of this project is creating a mobile app that works on almost all platforms (android-ios-web-linux) and supports several versions. The app sends keystrokes to a windows computer. 

Works in local network and matches with a related machines virtual port that opened by another related app.

## Computer(windows-linux-macos) side
a lightweight basic keystroke app with propper API. 

## Mobile side 
a flutter app with changable ui, key order or pad modes like (game pad, mouse pad, joystick, regular keyboard)
_In further updates i'll use sensors like gyro sensor to make a basic level virtual reality hand set like Oculuses._
